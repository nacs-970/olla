# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-10)

**Core value:** Stay fast and accurate on small local models — minimal per-turn token overhead so 2-4B models on constrained hardware stay responsive and don't drift under a bloated context.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Core Loop + Shell Tool + CLI

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Core Loop + Shell Tool + CLI)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-06-10 — Roadmap created, 16 v1 requirements mapped across 4 phases

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: ReAct loop with XML-style tags, no JSON tool schema — small models are unreliable at JSON function calling
- [Roadmap]: No hardcoded default model; target via `--model`
- [Roadmap]: Shell uses `shell=False` + `shlex.split()`, no pipes/redirects in v1 (SHELL-01) — resolves the STACK vs ARCHITECTURE/PITFALLS shell-mode conflict in favor of the safer model

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: XML-tag format compliance on sub-4B target models is unvalidated (PITFALLS Pitfall 1). Phase 1 smoke test must confirm or trigger plain-delimiter fallback. Highest-priority risk.
